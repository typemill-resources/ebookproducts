# The eBook Products Plugin

With the plugin you can create one or many product boxes for your eBooks and integrate them with a shortcode to and page.

## How it works

After activation you will see a new navigation-item called "ebookproducts" in the settings. There you can add one or more product-data for your eBook-box:

Simply add an individual ID to create a new product. Then fill out the forms with a title, description, image, two file-downloads and two alternative buttons. After that you can integrate the product box in any page with the following shortcode:

```
[:ebookproduct id="yourproductid":]
```

A download-box appear. The logic of the buttons is as follows: 

* If the user has the right to download the file, then the download button with the label will appear.
* If the user has not the right to download the file, then the alternative link-buttons will appear.

You can combine the ebookproduct with the register-plugin and create some alternative links for users without access, for example: 

* A link to the register-page like `/tm/register`.
* A link to an external ebook shop like Amazon so the user can buy your eBook without a registration on your website.

Here is a demonstration of the plugin on YouTube. The plugin-demonstration starts at minute 14, but if you want to understand all publishing features of Typemill and if you want to see how you can build a whole publishing pipeline, then I recommend to watch the whole video.
